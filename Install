 PREPARING UKRNL.JS PACKAGES AND SPACES
===============================================================================

Install the latest version of NodeJS. There is not mongo dependency
anymore.

 INSTALLING SCREEN AS ROOT
===============================================================================

~# apt-get install screen

 CONFIGURATION FILES
===============================================================================

The main configuration of the system is in the files listed below. You
do not need to change the kernel configuration, but the controller
configuration has all the entries you need to run your controllers. The
controller configuration file includes some examples. You can see the
Technical Reference for further details.

 ukrnl.json

 controller.json

 IMPORTANT NOTES
===============================================================================

You can find the contoller.json file with examples of how to define your
controllers. System controllers have ports defined between
36000-39999. User controllers have ports defined between 40000-60000.

If you wanna test the environment (optional), you can compile Init a
Processes modules by linking Makefile.example as Makefile, you need to
install build-essentials as root.

~# apt-get install gcc make build-essential

~# ln -s Makefile.example Makefile

~# make

Then start the screen and create two windows, in the first window start
the kernel and the second window is for the Processes controller.

~$ screen

The screen will automatically create the first window. You have to
create the second one.

Ctrl+a c

Then, list all windows to move between them.

Ctrl+a "

>>> Screen 1: Start the kernel <<<

~$ ./ukrnl.js

>>> Screen 2: Start the controller <<<

~$ ./ukrnl.js Processes

Then create another window, go to the test folder, and start executing
the test commands as:

>>> Screen 3: Testing space <<<

~$ cd test

~$ ./uktestMOD.0.js

~$ ./uktestMOD.1.js

~$ ./uktestMOD.2.js

~$ ./uktestMOD.3.js

Test 0 is gonna give you an error on purpose, 1 and 2 return a fast
result and 3 wait for 60 seconds before returning a result.
